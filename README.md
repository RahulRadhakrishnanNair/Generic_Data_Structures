# Generic Data Structures
This library is being created by me to attempt a library, similar to C++'s "Standard Template Library", however, making it generic by using void pointers and enumeration as a way to store any data type. 
I have utilised either structs or classes to create "blueprints" of the structure, being able to create instances wherever necessary.
Additionally, the use of enumeration for data types allows for the deferencing of void pointers to access the value.
The downside of this implementation is the amount of memory being used, as the structures are dynamically allocated, and will carry more data due to the use of void pointers, enums indicating the type of structure and data type. Compared to a regular, specific data type based data structure will carry less data.

# Data Structures
These are the data structures I am attempting to implement within the library:
- Stacks
- Queues/Circular Queues
- Dynamic Arrays
- Linked List (Singly/Doubly)
- Graphs
- Binary Trees

# Works in Progress
As of now (14th April 2025), these are the structures I am currently trying to implement:
- Stacks
- Singly Linked Lists

# Completed Structures
As of now (14th April 2025), no data structure has been completed.
