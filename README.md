## Features

- **Generic Design**: Use void pointers to create flexible data structures that can store any data type.
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Efficiently manage memory for data structures like linked lists and dynamic arrays.
- **Comprehensive Collection**: Implement a variety of data structures including binary trees, graphs, queues, and stacks.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on various platforms supporting C and C++.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RahulRadhakrishnanNair/Generic_Data_Structures.git
```

Navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd Generic_Data_Structures
```

You can then build the library using your preferred C/C++ compiler. Ensure that you have the necessary development tools installed.

## Usage

After installation, you can include the library in your projects. Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to use the linked list functionality:

```c
#include "linked_list.h"

int main() {
    LinkedList* list = createLinkedList();
    int data = 10;
    addToList(list, &data);
    // More operations...
    return 0;
}
```

Refer to the documentation for detailed usage instructions for each data structure.

## Data Structures Included

This library includes the following data structures:

- **Linked Lists**: Implemented using void pointers to allow for any data type.
- **Dynamic Arrays**: Manage arrays that can grow and shrink as needed.
- **Stacks**: LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure for managing data.
- **Queues**: FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure for managing data.
- **Binary Trees**: A versatile tree structure for efficient data organization.
- **Graphs**: Represent relationships between data points effectively.

### Linked Lists

Linked lists allow for efficient insertion and deletion of nodes. Each node can store data of any type using void pointers. 

### Dynamic Arrays

Dynamic arrays provide a way to manage arrays that can change size. This is particularly useful when the number of elements is not known in advance.

### Stacks

Stacks are useful for scenarios where you need to access the most recently added element first. This is commonly used in algorithms and programming language implementations.

### Queues

Queues are essential for scenarios where you need to process elements in the order they were added. This structure is often used in scheduling and resource management.

### Binary Trees

Binary trees allow for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of data. They are widely used in databases and memory management.

### Graphs

Graphs are useful for representing complex relationships and networks. They can be directed or undirected and can represent various real-world scenarios.
